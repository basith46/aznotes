## Azure Fundamentals

Azure is a public cloud provider, but it also offers private, hybrid, and multi-cloud solutions to users. Cloud services in Azure are designed to help users build innovative cloud solutions that help solve our challenges.

It allows us to build, develop, manage, and run resources like servers, databases, storage, or applications in multiple cloud environments. You can use it for different use cases in the cloud using the tools, programming languages, and frameworks that you prefer to use.

Azure offers over 200 services (as of time of writing) in various categories, including computing, networking, storage, databases, analytics, machine learning and AI, the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud-native, containers, and security. However, Microsoft continues to introduce new features and services to Azure regularly, so the number of services may increase over time.

## Benefits of a Cloud Provider



| Benefits              | Descriptions                                                                                                                                                                              |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| High availability     | Microsoft Azure provides high availability and redundancy across all of its worldwide data canters offering a service-level agreement that ensures 99.99% availability.                   |
| Geo-distribution      | Azure helps global enterprises by providing geo-distribution features. Geography-specific endpoints enables international enterprises to comply with regional compliance and regulations. |
| Scalability on-demand | When demand for complexity, traffic, and data expands, there is a flexible and quick way to handle such needs                                                                             |
| Reliability           | The system or application hosted functions correctly even in the face of adversity (hardware or software faults, and even human error)                                                    |
| Elasticity            | A capability to automatically scale cloud resources based on configuration or demand.                                                                                                     |
| Disaster recovery     | When your applications, data, and systems are hosted in Azure, you can be assured of secured end-to-end backup and disaster recovery solutions.                                           |
| Cost management tools | Tools available for cost management in Azure allow users to set budget alerts for their resource groups and resources.                                                                    |
| OpEx vs. CapEx        | Hosting to cloud means an organization can save money from capital expenditures (CapEx) and only pay for operational expenditures (OpEx).                                                 |

## Azure Portal&#x20;

The self-managed portal of Microsoftâ€™s cloud platform is called the _Azure Portal_; it can be accessed by Azure users on their web browsers or via the _Azure mobile app_. It is a web-based administration website for all types of Azure users, where you can manage the Azure cloud services for your organization. It is a powerful portal of cloud administration tools and resources.

* Use command-line tools and the cloud shell for quick creation and deployments
* Manage and organize Azure subscriptions and create management groups that helps in structuring and governing Azure resources
* Use Microsoft Entra ID to manage identity, access, and permissions to resources in Azure
* Configure and manage privacy, data, security, policies, and compliance vital to the organizationâ€™s governance
* Customize the portalâ€™s dashboards to get a quick overview of the status of resources right after you log in
* Take control of monthly costs by monitoring resources through spending limits and budget alerts using Azure Cost Management in the Azure Portal

## Compute Services in Azure&#x20;

Compute is the term used for computing resources. Compute services hosted in Azure provide computing resources like operating systems, networking, disks, processors, and memory. These compute resources are available quickly and on-demand for users. Every application is unique. An application can have many workloads that need more than one compute service.
